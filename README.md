# IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION
project based on Machine Learning 

## Overview

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their features. The Iris dataset is a popular dataset in machine learning, and this project aims to create an accurate classification model using Python.

## Features

- Utilizes machine learning techniques for flower classification.
- Implemented in Python, leveraging libraries such as scikit-learn for machine learning tasks.
- Trained on the well-known Iris dataset, which contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of Iris flowers.
